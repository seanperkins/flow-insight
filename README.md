## TwilightCity Desktop Application ##
TwilightCity is a desktop application and suite of tools to support Idea Flow Metrics and data-driven learning on a team.
 
 It works in tandem with a peer-to-peer socket server called Gridtalk, and a metrics engine and city server called GridTime. 
 
### Install from Source ###
The following will describe how to install 'TwilightCity' from source code, and connect to production community servers: "https://home.twilightcity.net" 
and for Gridtalk "https://gridtalk.twilightcity.net".  Please contact us for an API key.

Requirements:
- Node v14.18.0
- Xcode-CLI (`xcode-select --install`) (Mac Only)
- Yarn v1.2.x
- Git w/ CLI

0) Install git version control system from here:

https://git-scm.com/downloads

3) Open up a terminal window and navigate into a secure place where you store source code. The run the  git command:

`git clone https://github.com/twilightcity-net/twilightcity-desktop.git`

4) Using yarn, install the projects module dependencies with the following command in the terminal: 

`yarn install`

5) Done! Run the following command in your terminal to start the application:

`yarn dev` or `yarn .` 

***DRYCLEANING:*** Try running `yarn ..` to quickly clean and build: new documentation (for your IDEA), lint, compile, build and run in dev mode.

***OPTIONAL:*** To run the project using the local development mock api, use:

`yarn dev:local`

Note: hit `ctrl+c` to terminate the project.

### Running Integration and Unit Tests ###

1) Run the following command in the terminal to execute the entire sweet of tests:

`yarn test`

1) Run the following command in the terminal to execute a specific test (talk service for example:

`yarn test:talk`

***NOTE:*** These test files are found in './test/.' Certain configuration is required if you wish to create a new category of tests to be added. These files can also be executed without executing via our test framework.

### Updating Your Source Code From Repo ###

1) Run the following command in the terminal after making some file changes:

`yarn update`

### Install React Development Tools ###

`yarn dev` or `yarn .`

2) Wait for the app to load, and open the chrome dev window for the console window

        console.log("An error occurred: " + err);
     });`

4) Done. Yay. Have cake.

### Code Documentation

Thank you first for commenting your code. This project uses the module jsdoc to generate a static html API website that outlines all of our modules, classes, and functions. You can find documentation help and examples at the following links:

- https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc
- http://usejsdoc.org/index.html

To generate the static html documentation, run the following command:
`yarn docs`

`yarn release`

### Pushing Source Code To Repository ###

1) Run the following command in the terminal after making some file changes:

`yarn stage`

2) Commit your changes with this command: 

`git commit -m '<imperative_voice_description>'`

3) Then push your changes with:

`git push`

### Publish Torchie Release ###

1) Save a copy of `electron-builder.env.sample` -> `electron-builder.env` in the root directory of the project.
